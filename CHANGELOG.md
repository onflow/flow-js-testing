## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#155](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/pull/155) [`9dcab53`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/commit/9dcab535393654e3c6ba41a3ac41095519446c27) Thanks [@jribbink](https://github.com/jribbink)! - Allow custom transaction signers to be provided as object with `addr`, `privateKey`, `keyId`, `hashAlgorithm`, `signatureAlgorithm` keys as an alternative to supplying merely the signer's account address and having Flow JS Testing determine the rest. This allows for more complex transaction authorizers. See [documentation for examples](/docs/send-transactions.md).

* [#158](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/pull/158) [`57edf7d`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/commit/57edf7d215dd535ee8c4fa0e3dbc2d998efa8c79) Thanks [@jribbink](https://github.com/jribbink)! - Flow JS Testing now exports multiple new API methods:

  - [`pubFlowKey`](/docs/api.md#pubflowkeykeyobject) - may be used to generate an RLP-encoded `Buffer` representing a public key corresponding to a particular private key.
  - [`createAccount`](/docs/accounts.md#createaccountname-keys) method which may be used to manually create an account with a given human-readable name & specified keys.

  And exports the following two enums which may be used with [`createAccount`](/docs/accounts.md#createaccountname-keys) and [`sendTransaction`](/docs/send-transactions.md):

  - [`SignatureAlgorithm`](/docs/api.md#signaturealgorithm)
  - [`HashAlgorithm`](/docs/api.md#hashalgorithm)

- [#126](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/pull/126) [`3fc34f3`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/commit/3fc34f3f52f2623ca825ba84e05c774996bce67e) Thanks [@refi93](https://github.com/refi93)! - Add getTimeOffset/setTimeOffset utilities, allowing to advance the time while testing smart-contracts

* [#170](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/pull/170) [`da5e666`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/commit/da5e6667fd9cf134ea536d6c82ce5e649e86d28f) Thanks [@jribbink](https://github.com/jribbink)! - Emulator logs are now captured when calling `executeScript`, `sendTransaction`, `deployContract`, and `deployContractByName`. They part of the tuple returned by these functions (i.e. `[result, error, logs]`) and are provided as an array of strings.

- [#142](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/pull/142) [`9aecfdd`](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-testing/commit/9aecfdd67a98f4eb16b7350b8892c08d83dbd0f7) Thanks [@jribbink](https://github.com/jribbink)! - **BREAKING** Bumped @onflow/fcl to 1.1.1-alpha.1

  Developers should note that `[U]Int*` and `Word*` types are now decoded into strings by @onflow/fcl and no longer implicitly decoded into numbers. This means that these types will need to be explicitly converted to JavaScript Number types if required.

  This potentially affects the return values or event data for the following flow-js-testing features.

  - `sendTransaction` (any `[U]Int*` and `Word*` event data will be decoded into a string instead of number)
  - `executeScript` (any `[U]Int*` and `Word*` return values will be decoded into a string instead of number)
  - `deployContract`/`deployContractByName` (any `[U]Int*` and `Word*` event data will be decoded into a string instead of number)
  - `updateContract` (any `[U]Int*` and `Word*` event data will be decoded into a string instead of number)
  - `getBlockOffset` (return value will be string instead of number, and must be explicitly converted if JavaScript Number is required)

  - getBlockOffset
  - getFlowBalance

Any code that relies upon checking the result of any of these functions and expects only the result returned will need to be refactored.
Jest asserts were updated accordingly, but if you were writing your own you will need to update them.
For examples of new usage see the [script](/docs/exeute-scripts.md), [transaction](/docs/send-transactions.md) and [api](/docs/api.md) documentation.
